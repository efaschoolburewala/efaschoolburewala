---

## 👥 Multi-Role Shared Portal Architecture

The platform implements a **Dynamic Access Control System**. All users log in through a single entry point (`/login`), and the system dynamically resolves their dashboard layout, sidebar navigation, and actionable permissions:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Login /auth] --> B{Role Level Check}
    B -->|Role Level >= 90| C[Admin / Principal Dashboard]
    B -->|Role Level 50 - 89| D[Teacher Dashboard]
    B -->|Role Level 30 - 49| E[Accountant Dashboard]
    B -->|Role Level < 30| F[Student / Parent Portal]
    
    C --> G[Full System Control & Settings]
    D --> H[Class Attendance & Marks Entry]
    E --> I[Fee Collection & Expense Ledger]
    F --> J[Personal Profile & Result Cards]
```

### Supported User Roles
1. **Administrator / Principal (`Level 90+`)**: Full access to all modules, financial reporting, system settings, user management, and DB backups.
2. **Teacher (`Level 50 - 89`)**: Academic management, student mark entry, class attendance marking, and assigned subject views.
3. **Accountant / Cashier (`Level 30 - 49`)**: Fee slip generation, fee collection, admission fee ledgers, exam fee collection, and expense tracking.
4. **Student / Parent Portal (`Level < 30`)**: Profile overview, fee payment history, result cards, attendance record, and school notices.
5. **Custom Roles**: Unlimited custom roles (e.g., Coordinator, Vice Principal, Hostel Warden) with custom permission matrices.
